This package contains the current Miles Design VFX Graphics System releases 
for 32-bit protected-mode DOS (VFX V1.15) and Win32 (WinVFX V1.18).  VFX
and WinVFX have been used in dozens of bestselling PC games over the past
several years, ranging from SSI's AD&D titles to Digital Anvil's latest 
release, Starlancer.

VFX simplifies a number of real-time graphics tasks, such as font rendering 
and access to 2D pixel, line, and sprite primitives.  WinVFX and its 
companion W32SAL.DLL make it easy to build a Windows graphics application 
in minutes, hiding various Win32 subtleties such as fullscreen/windowed 
mode switching, display mode control, and DirectDraw/CreateDIBSection() 
abstraction from your application.

VFX is a fairly large API package with many features.  New users should begin 
by running and studying the example code in the WINVFX16\DEMO subdirectory, 
along with the API and tools manual (WINDOC\VFX_WW97.DOC, in Microsoft Word 97
format).

As of July 5, 2000, all source code and compiled object code in this package 
may be considered "open-source freeware," usable by anyone for any purpose,
commercial or otherwise, without restriction or limitation.  I strongly 
encourage, but do not require, anyone who adds any further value to this 
package to release their modifications and improvements under the same terms.

I expressly disclaim any liability for bugs, defects, or intellectual-property 
violations that may arise as a consequence of using the contents of this
package for any purpose, commercial or otherwise.  Use at your own risk!
